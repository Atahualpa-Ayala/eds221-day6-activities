lobsters \<- read_csv(here("data","Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20210412.csv"), na = c("-99999", " ")) %\>%

clean_names()

```{r}
lobsters <- read_csv(here("data","Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20210412.csv"), na = c("-99999", " ")) %>% 
  clean_names()%>%
  uncount(count)



```

Count made more row when one row it is one observation of lobsters


###Find counts and mean sizes by site & year
```{r}
lobsters_summ <- lobsters |>
  group_by(site, year) |> 
  select(site, year, size_mm) |>
  summarize(n(),  na.rm = TRUE, mean(size_mm)) |>
  rename( total_lobsters_observed = "n()" ,
         mean_lengths = "mean(size_mm)")


ggplot(lobsters_summ,  aes(x = year, y= total_lobsters_observed)) + 
          geom_line(aes(color=site)) +
          facet_wrap(~site)

```

```{r}
